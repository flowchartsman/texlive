# Using this image with vscode:

1. Install the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) extension.
2. Create a `.devcontainer` directory in the root of your workspace.
3. Place the `devcontainer.json` file from this director in your new `devcontainer` directory, and modify it as you like.

You can use whichever scheme image you want instead of the "full" image, and install any packages you might need with `tlmgr install <your package>`
